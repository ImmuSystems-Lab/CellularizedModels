# Multicellular Spatial Model of IFN Response to Viral Infection

This respository contains the code to implement the model and results presented in:

The directory Simulation_Code contains the code to simulate the model using CompuCell3D (CC3D). Users need a local 
version of CC3D to execute the code. Inside the directory, users can find the main simulation file: IFNModel.cc3d. 
To execute the base
